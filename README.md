# Practice Project: Learning Git and GitHub

This repository is part of my learning journey with **Git** as a version control system and **GitHub** as a platform for hosting and collaborating on code. It contains simple practice files, commands, and notes that helped me understand how Git and GitHub work.

## 📚 Project Goals

- Understand the basic Git workflow.
- Practice using commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, etc.
- Explore key GitHub features: remote repositories, branches, pull requests, and version tracking.
- Get familiar with the structure and purpose of files like `README.md`.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Git
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code (or any code editor)
- Terminal / Command Line

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Initializing and cloning repositories
- Making commits with meaningful messages
- Pushing changes to a remote repository
- Creating and merging branches
- Resolving basic merge conflicts
- Navigating and collaborating on GitHub

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

This project is meant for version control practice and does not need to be "run" like a typical software project. However, you can clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
